=head1 NAME

Template::ExpandHash - Do template expansion on the values of a hash.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Template::ExpandHash qw(expand_hash);
    # ... time passes
    %expanded_hash    = expand_hash(%hash);
    $expanded_hashref = expand_hash($hashref);

Pass a hash, get back a similar hash with [% key %] expanded into the value
associated with that key.  Recursive substitutions are supported, and the
substituting goes into sub-hashes.  (Sub-hashes can expand to keys from the
surrounding hash, but not vice versa.)  Template expressions can be escaped
using backslashes.

=head1 INTENDED USE CASE

When loading a configuration it often makes sense to start with a base
configuration data structure, and then load multiple layers of tweaks for
specific environments.  This can happen within pure Perl as in this example:

    $PARAM{prod} = {
        email_qa_email      => undef,
        email_pager_email   => 'pagerlist@company.com',
        some_escaped_value  => '\[% user ]%',
        # etc
        email => {
          qa_email          => '[% email_qa_email %]',
          pager_email       => '[% email_pager_email %]',
          # etc
        },
        # More data here.
    };

    $PARAM{sandbox} = {
        %{$PARAM{prod}},
        default_email       => '[% user %]@company.com',
        email_qa_email      => 'QA <[% default_email %]>',
        email_pager_email   => 'Pagers <[% default_email %]>',
        # More data here, some of which overrides prod.
    };

    $PARAM{btilly} = {
        %{$PARAM{sandbox}},
        user                => 'btilly',
        # More data here, some of which overrides the sandbox.
    };

Alternately it can happen in a series of files which you might load from
a list of external sources with code like this:

    use Config::Any;

    # ... code here.
    my $raw_config_list
        = Config::Any->load_files({files => \@config_path, use_ext => 1});
    my $config = {map %$_, map values %$_, @$raw_config_list};

Either way there is a tendency for the set of overrides at the detail level
to get very long.  However with templating we could make this much shorter.
Suppose that our final set of parameters worked out to be something like:

    $config =  {
        user                => 'btilly',
        default_email       => '[% user %]@company.com',
        email_qa_email      => 'QA <[% default_email %]>',
        email_pager_email   => 'Pagers <[% default_email %]>',
        some_escaped_value  => '\[% user ]%',
        # etc
        email => {
          qa_email          => '[% email_qa_email %]',
          pager_email       => '[% email_pager_email %]',
          # etc
        },
        # More data here.
    }

Then we can expand all of the template parameters:

    $expanded_param = expand_hash($param);

And get:

    {
        user               => 'btilly',
        default_email      => 'btilly@company.com',
        email_qa_email     => 'QA <btilly@company.com>',
        email_pager_email  => 'Pagers <btilly@company.com>',
        some_escaped_value => '[% user ]%',
        # etc
        email => {
            qa_email       => 'QA <btilly@company.com>',
            pager_email    => 'Pagers <btilly@company.com>',
            # etc
        },
        # More data here.
    }

without having to manually override a long list of values.  This makes your
configuration much simpler and cleaner than it otherwise would be.

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 expand_hash

The only externally usable function.  You pass it a hash or hash ref and it
will recursively expand template parameters and return you a hash or hash
ref.

=head1 TODO

=over 4

=item Error checking

No checks currently exist for malformed templates, or template references to
variables that are not available.  These would catch common typos and should
be added.

=item Performance

Currently it keeps on passing through the list of not yet done variables until
no further progress is made.  Calculating a dependency graph up front could
significantly help performance.

=item Refactor

All of the real work is done in one giant recursive function.  It could
profitably be broken up into more digestable pieces.

=item Conditionals and loops

Common template features do not work.  Perhaps they would be useful.

=item Recursive macro expansion

C<[% foo[% bar %] %]> does not currently work.  It may be simple to add.
